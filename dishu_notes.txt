Hello, my name is **Dishwanthi**. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.

I completed my graduation from **Sri Venkateswara university where I pursued a **BSc with a focus on Computers**. I graduated with **distinction ,in my major** and actively participated in academic and practical projects.

As part of my coursework, I worked on a **Python-based internal project** with a team of four members. In this project, we explored **data collection, string handling, data analysis, and logical implementation**. The application was designed to manage student data by matching registrations with individual **sports, cultural, and other college events**.
We also developed a **notification system** within the program to automatically inform selected students about their assigned events. This project helped streamline event organization and was later adapted for future college events as well.

Working on this project inspired me to further explore **coding, collaboration, and practical skill application**, not only in technical areas but also in teamwork and problem-solving.

In addition to my academic experience, I have worked as a **student organization volunteer for the Swachh Bharat initiative** and also contributed as a **computer data analyst for the electoral out bank**, where I handled and analyzed data responsibly.
